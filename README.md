# Analytical-Engineering
Project Overview**  
The project focuses on:  
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw job posting data  
- Extracting key insights such as salary ranges, job location, and company details  
- Identifying trends in job titles, required skills, and employer-provided benefits  
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Building predictive models to estimate salaries based on job descriptions
  
 Technologies & Tools Used**  
- Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- ML MOdels  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting  
- NLP
  - TF-IDF vectorization for extracting key job skills  
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) for company and location analysis  
-  Data Wrangling: Handling missing values, feature extraction, and categorical encoding  

Key Insights and findings 
-  Salary Prediction Models: Trained and evaluated models to predict salaries with high accuracy based on job descriptions.  
-  Feature Importance Analysis: Identified key features such as job title, industry, and required skills that significantly impact salary estimates.  
- Skill Demand Analysis: Used NLP techniques to analyze job postings and determine the most in-demand technical skills (Python, SQL, AWS, etc.).  
- Location Based Salary Trends Mapped out how salaries vary across different states and industries.
